      <description>Introduction  I have combined 4 data sets for this project. The independent variables that are joined, common for all data sets, are year and country. The dependent variables I am assessing are country code, population, deaths due to terrorist attacks, banking crisis incidence, and number of vehicles produced in a year. I chose these data sets to analyze the correlation between all of these variables over time and in different countries.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have combined data sets for this project. I used these 3 data sets for Project 1 as well. The independent variables that are joined, common for all data sets, are year and country. The dependent variables I am assessing are country code, population(number of people in country), banking crisis incidence(binary), and number of vehicles produced in a year. I again chose these data sets to analyze the correlation between all of these variables over time and in different countries.</description>
